// If lets say, car parking is full and there is a car requesting a parking lot, given available truck parking lots,
// allocate the truck parking space to the car at the price of car's parking price.

// We can also think about the Premium parking strategy where the parking slots near the entry/exit are relatively more
// expensive that than the parking lots of same category.

// Another strategy could be dynamic pricing based on hour of the day.
