 * There are two linked lists. Both linked lists have a single-digit number in their nodes. I needed to
treat this linked lists as a numbers and add them up and store the digits in a new linked list.
E.g., head -> 5 -> 6 -> 7-> 9
head -> 2-> 1 -> 1
Resultant linked list: head-> 5 -> 8-> 9-> 0 (5679 + 211 = 5890)

	// Store the sum in a new linked list.
	// After addition is complete, reverse the final linked list again.
